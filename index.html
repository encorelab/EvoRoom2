				To gain entry into our elite team of rainforest ecologists, you must successfully complete this exercise,

				30 minutes to complete.

				When you are ready to begin, proceed to the simulation lab (in room 204a) and perform a QR scan with this device.

				There are four different versions the Borneo rainforest ecosystem here. Why do they look different?
				What happened to these systems? As part of today's exercise you will work with the others in this room to
				figure this out.
				<br><br>
				But first, to facilitate the problem-solving process, you are asked to look for these species (shown above)
				within their speciality, across all four rainforests. This is a divide and conquer strategy for everyone to take
				stock of the species are in the rainforest ecosystems.
				<br><br>
				When you are ready, approach one of the rainforest stations and perform a QR scan.
